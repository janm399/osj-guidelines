#Open Source Journal Publishing Guidelines

Follow the structure of this document to write a good article for the OSJ. The preferred format for the OSJ submissions os *Open Document* or *markdown*, whichever you prefer.

The format of the Open Document should follow the markdown formatting:

* Heading 1-5
* Normal paragraph text
* Inline ``code``, block code
* Numbered & unnumbered lists
* Images
* Tables

These formats translate directly to the markdown syntax. If you are using Open Document, do not use any advanced formatting.

For example, head over to [sample.md](https://github.com/janm399/osj-guidelines/blob/master/sample.md); or for a full article from an older issue of OSJ, head over to [cake.md](https://github.com/janm399/osj-guidelines/blob/master/cake.md).

The markdown/GibHub approach lends itself very easily to adding source code to your article. Feel free to follow the outline here.
